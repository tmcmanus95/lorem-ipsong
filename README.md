# Lorem-Ipsong

A JavaScript application that allows users to generate placeholder text composed of commonly used words by genre.

# Description

This vanilla JavaScript application allows users to generate placeholder text composed of commonly used words by genre, namely, Black Metal, Rap, Indie, and Country. Words were chosen through a combination of frequency of use and unique association.

To use this application, select a genre, and input the number of paragraphs (1-10) you would like to generate.

To copy the text to your clipboard, click the copy paste button that appears in the top right of the screen upon generation.
